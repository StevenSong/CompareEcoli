### Purpose
Can we use genome-scale models for *E. coli*, obtained from [BiGG Database](https://github.com/sbrg/bigg_models), and flux based analysis to predict strain efficiency at given tasks?

### Usage
Prerequisites:  
- Python 3
- Matlab 2019a
- [COBRA Toolbox](https://github.com/opencobra/cobratoolbox)

Steps to Run:
1. Initialize COBRA Toolbox
